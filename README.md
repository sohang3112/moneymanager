# Money Manager

Web UI for [Money Manager app](https://www.realbyteapps.com/) which is supported on Android, iOS but not laptops / web.
Currently read-only interface, aim to add editing capability later.

Works by reading *.mmbak* files (which are actually Sqlite databases) that are periodically backed up by the app to "Money Manager" folder in Google Drive.
